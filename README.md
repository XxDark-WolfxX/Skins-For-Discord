# Skins-For-Discord
These are custom themes for Discord users using BetterDiscord, LegCord, or Vencord.

If you find a bug, feel free to suggest an edit. If I don't respond in three days, feel free to email me @Dark_Wolf_Entertainment@outlook.com.

These are based on Microsoft's Windows 11 Fluid ui, and Fuvi from BetterDiscord. The credit for the idea goes to @FeoreV, as well as @Microsoft.

Expect updates to this repository from time to time.

## instructions:

1. Download the .zip
2. Move it to your vencord folder (for windows, it would be in C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\Vencord)
3. In the vencord folder, there is a themes foler. Put these in there.
4. Launch Discord, and navigate to settings. 
5. Go to the settings for Vencord (usually in the middle somewhere under it's own catagory named Vencord)
6. open the Themes setting, and your themes are there. Find the one you desire, and just click on it.

And there you have it, your very own non-discord theme! Your welcome.
